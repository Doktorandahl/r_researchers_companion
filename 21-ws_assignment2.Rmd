# Assignment for workshop 2 {-}

```
### Workshop 2 assignment
### Write your code underneath each of the instructions

# Download the DECO data on deadly electoral violence events and the reduced vdem dataset available in the file area on studium (and the module page for the Rworkshop)

# Load these two data sets into R

# Inspect the variable names of the two data sets

# Create a dummy variable taking the value one if the number of civilian deaths for an event is greater than 0 in the DECO data

# Filter out all observations which do not have any civilian deaths in the DECO data

# Select the variables id, type_of_violence, country_id, country, region, civilian_deaths, best, high, and low to keep in your data (note you use the DECO data here)

(Note, you can do all three of these steps in one go)

# Present summary statistics of the mean, standard deviation, and max of civilian_deaths by type_of_violence in the DECO data

# Present summary statistics of the mean, standard deviation, and max of civilian_deaths by type_of_violence and region in the DECO data

## Bonus, what does this tell us?

# Aggregate the deco data to the country-year level

# Merge your aggregated data set with the reduced vdem data set. Note, I have made sure that the country id variables of both data sets match

## Bonus, which type of _join is appropriate if we are planning on investigating electoral violence? Why?
