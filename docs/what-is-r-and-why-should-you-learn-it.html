<p>So, what is R really? Well, R is a programming language which was developed as a free open source successor to the <em>S</em> programming language and first saw the light of day in the early 1990s’. However, R is not like other programming languages which are often times built around being able to build general purpose applications for use in computer programs, apps, and websites. Instead, R is a <em>statistical</em> programming language, built by statisticians and data scientists specifically for the purpose of being a tool for data handling, data presentation, and data analysis.</p>
<p>The fact that R is a programming language allows you to build your own tools or use tools others have built and made available in the over 17,000 unique packages for R in order to best analyze your data and provide answers to your research questions. This flexibility makes R a highly versatile and powerful tool for conducting your analysis compared to alternative data analysis <em>software</em> such as SPSS, STATA, SAS, and Excel, which locks the user into the tools available in those specific software. On top of that, R allows you to work directly with the data in a way that no competitor can, it allows you to deep dive into analyses of sub-samples and sub-groups, to merge, transform, and otherwise wrangle data in ways which in other software or programming languages are complicated at best, all while keeping the syntax and workflow neat and tidy. In essence, R is the best tool available for handling and analyzing data currently available.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-learn-r" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="1.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Why learn R?<a href="what-is-r-and-why-should-you-learn-it.html#why-learn-r" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>You might think to yourself: <em>I’m not interested in programming and I just want to be able to conduct some basic data analysis. Why should I learn R?</em> Great question! Apart from the obvious reason mentioned above, that R is the best tool available for handling and analyzing data, there are several other reasons one should learn R, and the fact that R is free, there are several good reasons why you should invest the time in learning R. First and foremost among these is that learning R will help you better understand the data you are working with and the methods you are trying to use to analyze this data. Being able to easily dive into the data by filtering, selecting, summarizing, and aggregating the raw data along the way brings you <em>closer</em> to the data and allows you to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of your data in a way which is neigh on impossible without a flexible tool like R.</p>
<p>R also offers you better opportunities to learn about the methods you are using. If you get a weird or unexpected result when doing the analysis, R offers you the tools to figure out what is happening and whether the results are an effect of something going wrong in the analysis, or if there are quirks in the data which generate these odd results. By working in R you are also promoting the ideal of reproducible research. Since R is open source and free, sharing the R code for your analysis with colleagues or reviewers allows them to see what you have done and thereby easier replicate your results or build on the results when conducting their own research.</p>
<p>The flexibility of R and the ability to work outside the box also tend to generate new types of research questions, as your mind is free to look for interesting phenomena outside the ones which are possible to analyze within a strict framework of already existing models. This is particularly true when you (at a later point in your journey into research methodology!) start to understand what the limits of the most common statistical methods are and you want to move past these to address new types of questions which may arise.</p>
<p>Finally, knowing R is a highly marketable skill, and you will never regret having learned the basics in R even if you end up in a job where this is not used. We are inexorably moving towards a more interconnected world which produces reams upon reams of data about both you and the world you live in, which will inevitably be used in different types of analysis. Having a basic understanding of how such analysis may be done is therefore fast becoming somewhat of a life skill and something which everyone ought to have.</p>

<div id="how-to-approach-learning-r" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="1.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> How to approach learning R<a href="what-is-r-and-why-should-you-learn-it.html#how-to-approach-learning-r" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Now that you’re convinced of the importance of learning R, how should you approach this topic? R is a programming <em>language</em> and learning R is therefore similar to learning a language. However, instead of concepts such as “adjectives,” “verbs,” and “nouns,” you will have to learn concepts such as “objects,” “functions,” and “arguments.” At times it will be frustrating, and at times you will just want to give up. Just remember that as with learning any language, practice is the key to succeeding. However, there are also some key differences in learning a <em>programming</em> language compared to a human language.</p>
<p>Primary among these are that when you are communicating in a human language in which you are not fully fluent, the receiver of the communication is usually able to interpret what you’re saying despite potential grammatical or other linguistic mistakes and you may therefore make yourself understood despite lacking some of the fundamental understanding of the language. In programming languages, on the other hand, the interpreter is completely unable to understand you if you make any errors in your syntax (akin to grammar in human languages) or if you have any spelling errors in your code. Thus, while it may be frustrating to start learning R by learning things like the equivalent of “Hi, my name is X” or the duolingo-style “The shark did not eat the helicopter” when all you want to do is dive into deeper conversations about the philosophy of science, it is absolutely essential to build a solid foundation of understanding the structure of the language before moving on to the more advanced topics.</p>
<p>Another difference between human languages and R is that while R, as all programming languages, is completely inflexible when it comes to the syntax and spelling, it also very flexible and has very few opinions on what is the ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ way of doing things. Thus, as long as you use correct syntax there are usually a multitude of different ways of doing the same thing, of which neither is necessarily more right or wrong. This feature of R may sometimes be confusing, but it also allows you to use R in the way that is most intuitive to you. It also allows you to develop your specific way of writing R over time and constantly improve the way you write your code for your data analysis.</p>
<p>As with any language, however, the only real way of learning it is by using it. In order to learn R properly you therefore need to find useful projects on which you can use the skills you learn here. Maybe you have some data associated with a course paper or working paper you want to dive deeper into and explore, or maybe you want to use the trial data sets provided with this book to investigate certain relationships. My recommendation would therefore be to find a project or find some data which you are interested in exploring, and keep it near at hand when you are reading this book. The code snippets that will be provided in this book can be seen as phrases from an old-school phrase-book. They are not useful if you only repeat them for yourself, they become useful when you apply them to your own data and adapt them to the specific situation you are in.</p>

So, what is R really? Well, R is in essence a statistical programming language and software which we can use to do statistical analyses. It's a highly powerful and flexible program that can do all sorts of things, and which you can use to make your own programs and tools which you often use. Simply put, it's quite a lot like a statistics sandbox. It can be quite daunting to learn R, and the learning curve is sometimes quite steep, but something to remember is that google is always your friend. Since R is a program which requires you to write what you do, there are a thousand and one tutorials and help pages available online, so if you get stuck you can always try googeling your problem. As I mentioned, R is a language, and learning R is pretty similar to learning a language. However, instead of concepts such as "adjectives", "verbs", and "nouns", you will have to learn concepts such as "objects", "functions", and "arugments". At times it will be frustrating, and at times you will just want to give up. Just remember that as with learning any language, practice is the key to succeeding. It is also important to know taht R is a very flexible language, which means that there are usually a multitude of different ways of doing the same thing. This may sometimes be confusing, but it also allows you to use the methods that are most intuitive to you in order to get what you need done done. Today, we are going to go through some basics of R, how it works, and what some of the fundamental concepts are. In the first three hours of the workshop, we will cover the basics of R, and the basics of importing and manipulating data. The fourth hour will cover some slightly more advanced topics which are required for the Methods II Advanced course, but I would still encourage all of you to stay for that hour.
